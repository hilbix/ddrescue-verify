A quick an dirty verifyer for gddrescue images
# This comment must be followed by a blank line!

After doing some rescue with ddrescue, you want to verify your image.  However there is no compare option.

This adds a compare for ddrescue using the written log file using cryptographic checksums (md5).  Apply this as follows:

- To create the MD5, run it with the image and the log file and write the output to a file
- To verify the MD5, run it with the image and the previous output

Easy and convenient.  There are some options to control skipping small parts, like in damaged parts of the drive, or use a different blocksize on read.
